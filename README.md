This repository presents a complete Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and modelling pipeline for heart disease prediction using a structured clinical dataset (from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/johnsmith88/heart-disease-dataset). There are four Colab notebooks (version 2025-13-11, Python 12.3), a dataset csv file and a paper PDF with the analysis results. The worflow covers data analysis, cleaning, transformation, dimensionality reduction, feature selection, and supervised modelling; with a strong emphasis on interpretability and methodological justification.
